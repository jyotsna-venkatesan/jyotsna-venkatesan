# Jyotsna Venkatesan

**`Aspiring Software Developer`**

I'm currently a Year-3 Student at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University majoring in Computer Science 💻 with a minor in Business Economics 💰. From planning and designing to execution and debugging, I'm taking the digital world one step at a time. I believe code is one of the most powerful ways to solving real life problems and I enjoy identifying these and working on them in my free time. When I'm not working on these, I spend my time crocheting 🧶 and cooking 🍽️
