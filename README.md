# Jyotsna Venkatesan

**`Aspiring Software Developer`**

I'm currently a Year-3 student at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University, majoring in Computer Science 💻 with a minor in Business Economics 💰. From planning and designing to execution and debugging, I'm taking the digital world one step at a time. I believe code is one of the most powerful ways to solve real-life problems, and I enjoy identifying and working on these in my free time. When I'm not coding, I spend my time crocheting 🧶 and cooking 🍽️.
